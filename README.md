Kustomize is a configuration management tool for Kubernetes that allows you to customize Kubernetes manifests without modifying the original YAML files. It enables you to manage Kubernetes deployments across multiple environments (like dev, staging, and prod) using reusable and maintainable base configurations and overlays.
